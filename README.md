# E-commerce Homework

This project implements the core of an e-commerce system with `Product` and `Category` classes.

## Functionality
- **Product class**: Stores name, description, price, and quantity of a product.
- **Category class**: Manages categories with name, description, and a list of products. Tracks total categories (`category_count`) and products (`product_count`).
- **Main script**: Demonstrates usage of classes with sample products and categories (`main.py`).
- **Tests**: Comprehensive tests for initialization, counters, and edge cases using pytest (`tests/test_classes.py`).
- **Linting**: Code adheres to PEP 8 standards, checked with flake8.
